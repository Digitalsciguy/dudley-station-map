Dudley Station connects 17 different bus lines, managing 16,000 boardings per weekday ([source](https://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Portals/49/Docs/Focus40BusReport.pdf)). But finding your stop is difficult over almost two acres of platforms. I couldn't find any existing maps of the station (except for [one 10 year old poster](2007_poster.jpg), which is not available online), so I made one.

Feedback is very welcome, whether it's about design, factual errors, or MBTA intellectual property policies. I'm also looking for more examples of bus platform maps to compare to.
[Ashmont](Ashmont_Platform_Map.jpg) has a map, and [London](https://tfl.gov.uk/maps_/bus-spider-maps) has some [good examples](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/bus-route-maps/elephant-castle-0716.pdf).
